This project aims to extract audio feature by the deep neural network [**SoundNet**](http://soundnet.csail.mit.edu/) implemented by **Yusuf Aytar, Carl Vondrick,  Antonio Torralba** in Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The original code is implemented in torch, here we use the [Tensorflow version](https://github.com/eborboihuc/SoundNet-tensorflow), and the conversion work from torch to tensorflow is done by **Hou-Ning Hu**.
